<h2>For students applying through Common App</h2>
<p1> - Decide which life story of yours', reflects about you more.  Do not build a fake story! I repeat, Do not build a fake story! <br>
- Start writing your Common Application essay. A good essay will take 2-3 months to complete. <br>
- Decide the subject you want to major on. <br>
- Search for the colleges with help of various website (i.e. usnews, forbes, niche, collegedata ) <br>
<br>
NOTE : In Early Decision and Early Action, students can apply early and get the decision early. In rolling admission, students will get the decision according to the number of application pool in the time period you have applied. Early Decision II, is the second chance for the students who missed the deadline or have been rejected on Early Decision and Early Action. Student get to apply to only one college in Early Decision and Early Decision II. Rolling Admission will have late deadlines. Regular Decision is the regular period to apply and students will receive the decision by April.<br>
<br>
- Choose for the application round you want to apply on and make a list of the colleges to keep the track on or common application dashboard will do it for you. <br>
- Look for the acceptance rate, minimum requirements, financial aid for the international student. Normally highly ranked colleges accept 2-3 students from the same country. <br>
- Although college might state need based aid but mostly financial aid decisions are made on the basis of financial situtaion and academics. <br>
- Search for the college in the common app and add them to the dashboard. You can add 20 colleges to your profile. <br>
- Ask your counselor/ teachers to create the common app account and complete the required procedures. <br>
- Check whether colleges require supplement essays or not. Supplement essays also make an great impact on your admission decision and should also meet the standard of your personal essay. <br>
- You need to fill the ISFAA/CSS as per the college requirement. Again, be genuine here, enter the amount of your family income, expense and the college fee your family or you yourself can afford. For sample check them on sample documents.<br>
<br>
NOTE: In ISFAA you are asked to fill your family income, family expenses, family assets, Family members and their dependence on the income of the family so that college can determine how much you can afford on your undergraduate. You can download the PDF file and fill them and scan.
 CSS is an online system managed by CollegeBoard.<br>
It works as a subsitute of ISFAA. While submitting the ISFAA is free to the college, you can scan and send an email. But, to submit CSS you need to pay $16 per college. Some colleges will ask for ISFAA whereas some will only ask for CSS.<br>
<br>
- Some "need based blind" colleges (eg. Harvard) will only look to your financial requirement after the admission decision. But, most of them do not. <br>
- Most of the colleges will accept the .pdf version of the SAT and TOEFL score you have submitted while applying. You may need to submit officially if you plan to attend the college. <br>
- If you have completed your personal essay, ISFAA/CSS, received your test scores then do not wait for the deadline. Apply as soon as you have completed your checklist. <br>
- Now scan your transcript, ECA certificates, ISFAA, Certificate of Finance and email them to the colleges you have applied or upload them in their respective admission portal.<br>
- Wait till the decision deadline and keep checking their admission portal. <br>
- You will have your decisions soon. After receiving the decision from all of the colleges compare them and order the i-20 from the college of your choice.<br>
- Now the colleges might ask for your certificate of finance whereas some might have already asked them before. You need supporting materials like income certificate,bank balance certificate, tax payment certificate attached to it or attached to ISFAA.
